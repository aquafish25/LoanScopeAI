# LoanScopeAI
LoanScopeAI is a tool that predicts loan eligibility by analyzing applicant data for smarter, faster lending decisions.

## üìò Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of the **TabTransformer** architecture. The TabTransformer leverages Transformer-based self-attention mechanisms to model relationships among categorical features, offering enhanced performance over traditional methods.

The implementation is inspired by the original paper:  
> **TabTransformer: Tabular Data Modeling Using Contextual Embeddings**  
> Xin Huang, Ashish Khetan, Milan Cvitkovic, Zohar Karnin  
> [arXiv:2012.06678](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06678)

## üöÄ Pipeline Overview

### 1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**

- **Objective**: Read and preprocess the dataset to ensure quality inputs.
- **Process**:
  - Load data from a CSV file.
  - Clean numerical columns by removing symbols like `$` and `%`.
  - Convert data types appropriately and handle missing values by dropping incomplete rows.

### 2. **Feature Engineering**

- **Objective**: Transform raw data into a suitable format for model training.
- **Components**:
  - **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using `LabelEncoder`.
  - **Feature Selection**: Select top `k` continuous features based on mutual information scores.
  - **Scaling**: Standardize continuous features using `StandardScaler`.
  - **Target Encoding**: Encode the target variable into numerical labels.

### 3. **Dataset Preparation**

- **Objective**: Structure the data for PyTorch model consumption.
- **Process**:
  - Split the data into training and validation sets.
  - Create a custom `TabularDataset` class inheriting from `torch.utils.data.Dataset` to handle data loading.
  - Utilize `DataLoader` for batching and shuffling.

### 4. **Model Architecture: TabTransformer**

- **Objective**: Implement the TabTransformer model to handle both categorical and continuous features.
- **Structure**:
  - **Embeddings**: Learn embeddings for categorical features.
  - **Transformer Encoder**: Apply self-attention mechanisms to capture relationships among categorical features.
  - **Continuous Feature Processing**: Normalize and project continuous features.
  - **MLP Head**: Combine processed features and pass through a Multi-Layer Perceptron for classification.

### 5. **Training & Evaluation**

- **Objective**: Train the model and evaluate its performance.
- **Process**:
  - Define a `TabTransformerTrainer` class to handle training loops, validation, and early stopping.
  - Use `CrossEntropyLoss` as the loss function.
  - Implement learning rate scheduling and gradient clipping.
  - Save the best model based on validation loss.

### 6. **Saving & Loading**

- **Objective**: Persist the trained model and feature engineering pipeline for future use.
- **Process**:
  - Save the model's state dictionary using `torch.save()`.
  - Serialize the feature engineering pipeline using `pickle`.
